Title & Purpose ::: Classify whether a picture of food contains a specific food item or not
Feature ::: 
a) A dataset of food images
b) Use of architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN)
c) Modelling for binary image classification with CNNs
d) Preparation of data for modelling (transforming image data into embeddings)
e) Creation of a CNN model (starting with a baseline)
f) Fit the model (getting it to find patterns in our data)
g) Evaluate the model
h) Improve the model
i) Make prediction with a trained model

Usage ::: Identifying food items model can be used further with advancements for multi food items classification
Tools Used ::: TensorFlow,Keras,CNN,Python
